# AStar Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the AStar algorithm, developed as part of the academic project for the Programming 3 and Software Engineering courses at Parthenope University of Naples.

## Introduction

The AStar algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph. It intelligently balances between the cost of the path and the estimated distance to the goal, making it efficient for various applications, including navigation systems, video games, and robotics.

## Features

- AStar algorithm implementation for pathfinding
- Supports both weighted and unweighted graphs
- Heuristic functions for estimating distance (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance)
- Customizable graph representation and input format
- Detailed documentation and code comments for easy understanding

## Getting Started

To use this AStar algorithm implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/carminecoppola/AStar-Implementations.git`
2. Compile the source code: `javac AStar.java`
3. Run the program: `java AStar`
4. Follow the prompts to provide the necessary inputs (graph structure, start and goal nodes, etc.)
5. The program will output the shortest path found using the AStar algorithm.
